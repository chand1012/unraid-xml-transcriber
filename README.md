# UnRAID XML Transcriber.

This is a JSON to XML transcriber that allows the use of RainMeter to Monitor your unRAID servers. Currently you need [unRAIDAPI](https://tinyurl.com/y5zwvfx3) installed alongside this container to work, and the container needs the environment variable `API_HOST` set to the IP of the container hosting unRAIDAPI. Template for this Container, along with all my other ones, can be found [here](https://github.com/chand1012/docker-templates).
